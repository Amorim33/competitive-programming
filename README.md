# Computational Thinking
A set of algorithms and resources to help you understand the world around us, with computer science.

## About
In few years of competitive proggramming experience, I had many doubts, like 
```
Where to start? | How to implement this? | For what is this useful?.
```
Thinking about it I decided to build that open source repository.😁<br />
Here we are free to share our knoledge in any algorithms, data structures and whatever you find interesting in computer science world!

## Guidelines
### Studying 📖

The repository follows a simple pattern, in the root we have a set of folders named with the topic it addresses. Inside the folders, there are jupyter notebook files describing and implementing algorithms related to the theme, as well as references and possible solutions for problems in online judges that can be solved with these algorithms.

### Contributing 💻

In order to contribute with our project, you should `fork` the repository and open a `pull request` following that pattern:
```
- [Topic Name] -> folder
  - [algorithm_name.ipynb] -> jupyter notebook
  - solutions -> folder
    - [your_solution] -> language of your preference
```
*Obs: Use markdown to describe your implementation, as clear as possible*
